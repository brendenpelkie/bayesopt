# Bayesian Optimization 
For Design of Experiments, W23, CHEME 599

Notes to grader:

- Notebooks for applications are in the `notebooks` directory. These have not been tested on google colab. Janky grid spacing code will probably overload the limited resources there.

- Bayesian optimization framework code in `bayesopt`


### To run notebooks locally:

1. Install requiremnets by building a conda environment from included conda file. This condafile generated on macOS.
2. Install bayesopt package by cloning this repo, running `pip install -e .` in root.
3. Launch notebooks and pray.
